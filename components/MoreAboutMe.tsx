            "The journey of coding is something I didn't want at the beginning, but now it has become a major part of my identity.
            When preparing for Mains and Advance, I only studied Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, unaware of the power of Computer Programming.
            In 2019, I started my college journey as an Electronics Student, knowing only a bit about HTML. Coming from a small town, being proficient in Powerpoint alone made me feel like a guy who knows computers well.
            However, everything changed when I stepped into my first computer lab. Terms like C, Python, List, Array, and Abstract data began to overwhelm me. Despite grasping their meanings, I struggled and completed my first year with a D grade in Computer Programming.
            Also, E.C.E. being itself a vast course, has its own challenges, but somehow I found a liking for this subject, maybe due to multiple labs and experiments. But then the COVID-19 pandemic happened.
            Education shifted online, and even E.C.E. became more about learning different programming languages like MATLAB, VHDL, etc.
            Struggling again with codes, I reached the 3rd Year somehow maintaining a GPA around 7.8.
            Then I encountered the toughest challenge - securing placements during a recession. Realizing that aiming for a package above 10LPA required proficiency in DSA, I chose Python as my programming language to achieve this.
            Studying E.C.E. subjects became only a compulsion for having good grades to sit in high G.P.A. requiring companies.
            This is the position when I was not true to myself, just doing things others were defining for me, not realizing that I was losing myself. One thing I know for sure is that I was not happy.
            Then I saw one of my closest persons creating websites. Changing background colors and adding images was enough for me to study this.
            Things from outside looked simple, but when I started doing it, it became something like peeling onion layers one by one.
            So, web development came into the picture, leading me to study JavaScript, then HTML (again), and CSS.
            However, a personal struggle arose between Python and JavaScript. Balancing these, as companies started recruiting from my college, I faced new challenges requiring knowledge in Database Management System, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Object-Oriented Programming.
            Now things started going south for me; I was neither concentrated on web development nor on the topics I needed to study for placement.
            As my fourth year started, I realized that concentrating on one path at a time was the solution I had been neglecting for too long.
            This realization led me to make a significant decision - to focus completely on JavaScript (though it's still ongoing). I developed my first HTML, CSS, JavaScript project, 'BLACKJACK,' followed by a Chrome extension named 'Link Copier' (available in the project section).
            So, when I felt, "Okay! Now I am a developer," 'React' said Hi to me. I completed a React tutorial Udemy course, created several projects in React and Tailwind.
            Till now, I had not completed any major full-stack project; then 'NextJs' joined the party, unleashing server-side rendering, routing, SEO, smooth integration with the backend through API routing, and many more. Thus, I created Neeli Chidiya and then the biggest project 'Spotify Clone.'
            While I'm still more inclined towards Frontend, I refuse to halt my journey here. Web Development initially sparked hope within me, and now I'm striving to integrate it into my identity. I will wake up every day to do more and more GitHub commits, study JavaScript repeatedly, and undertake new projects to explore additional tech stacks.
            Well, now if I think about it, creating something from scratch makes me happy, maybe that was the reason for me to like E.C.E., because I was doing experiments and looking for answers by myself.
            Thanks if you have read till now.
